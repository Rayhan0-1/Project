#About Project
This is a Mark Sheet generator.
I have made this project by using the C++ program. This project collects the student's name, university name, batch and other personal details. It calculates total marks and percentages based on subject-wise input and generates an academic mark sheet. It offers input validation and allows users to decide whether to generate their mark transcripts. The project streamlines the marks generation process, reducing manual efforts and potential errors.
